# Modeling Economic Influences on U.S. Housing Prices (2000‚Äì2023)

## üìå Objective
This project explores how key economic and demographic factors have influenced U.S. home prices over the last 20 years. Using the S&P Case-Shiller Index as a proxy for housing prices, the project builds and compares multiple regression models to predict and interpret historical trends.

---

## üìä Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Used **S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index** from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA).
- Supplemented with economic and social indicators from FRED and World Bank.

### 2. Influencing Variables
- **Economic Metrics:** GDP per Capita, CPI, Median Income, Construction Prices, Interest Rates
- **Labor Market:** Employment Rate, Unemployment Rate, Working-age Population
- **Demographics:** Urban Population %, Population above 65, Total Households
- **Policy & Supply:** Housing Subsidies, Number of New Houses Supplied

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and transformed data
- Addressed missing values and outliers
- Converted date formats and ensured time alignment

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized time trends and distributions
- Identified correlations and feature interdependencies

### 5. Model Building
- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - Linear Regression
  - ElasticNet
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - XGBoost

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Metrics: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R¬≤)**
- Cross-validation for robustness

### 7. Feature Importance Analysis
- Interpreted tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Identified most influential predictors

### 8. Visualization
- Actual vs. Predicted prices
- Feature importance plots
- Temporal trends and model insights

---

## ‚úÖ Results
- Tree-based models like **XGBoost** outperformed others in accuracy.
- Top predictors included **Interest Rates**, **GDP per Capita**, and **Urban Population Share**.
- The model provides both predictive insight and explanatory value for policy and investment decisions.

## üìå Conclusion

This analysis not only demonstrates how economic indicators influence U.S. housing prices but also builds a solid foundation for applying machine learning to real estate forecasting and economic policy planning.
